# Help! Windows says this is a virus!
Mushroom Launcher is fully open source, you can build it yourself, however this is just the nature of a program that modifies another program at runtime.

## Mod Creation
- Enable "Mod Developer" mode
- Click "Create Mod" in the mods tab
- Enter ID, Name, and a URL (doesn't need to exist yet)
- Browse to the mod folder after creation
- Add replacement files (Currently only XML under /Data/Xml)
- For example to replace stringcommon.xml
-         /mods/<modId>/Data/Xml/string/stringcommon.xml

- After adding files click "Add Local Files"
- Upload the mod folder to the URL, ensure that the mod isn't disabled.
- The launcher will hash check each file and ensure that it only downloads changed mod files on update.
